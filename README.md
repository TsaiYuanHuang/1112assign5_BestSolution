# Level C:
- Complete the Chicken class (Chicken.pde) including its constructor, isWin() and move() methods.
Please ensure that the constructor fills in the default values for the chicken's properties..
- Ensure that the isWin() method returns true when the chicken reaches the finish line.
- In the move() method, the chicken's x and y position will be updated based on the corresponding direction and constrained within the screen boundaries.
- After completing this part, you will be able to control the chicken and receive a win message upon reaching the finish line.

# Level B:
- Complete the Car class (Car.pde) including its constructor, and move() methods.
Please ensure that the constructor fills in the default values for the car's properties..
- In the move() method, the car should move from right to left with the carSpeed and shift to the right when it moves out of the left boundary.
- Complete the main program (chickenrun_oop.pde) so that it produces the same result as the chickenrun.pde program, which includes five cars running on lanes and hitting the chicken to trigger a game over. 

# Level A:
- Please create an overloading method named 'isHit' that takes a Chicken object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input chicken has collided with a car.
- Please use the 'isHit' method in the main program to perform collision detection between the chicken and the five cars.
